# ðŸš— Auto MPG Interactive Dashboard

This repository contains a **programmatic dashboard project** built using **Panel** and **hvPlot** in Python.  
The project was developed as part of the **Data Science - Module 7 Assignment (Option B/2)** to create an **interactive data visualization dashboard** that enables users to explore and analyze car fuel efficiency data dynamically.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

The dataset used in this project is the **Auto MPG dataset**, which provides information about various car attributes such as fuel efficiency (MPG), engine cylinders, weight, and model year.  

The dashboard aims to explore the following analytical questions:

1. What is the distribution of MPG values across all cars?  
2. Are there differences in average MPG based on the number of cylinders?  
3. What is the relationship between car weight and MPG?  
4. How has the average MPG trend changed over the years?

## ðŸ§© Features

- **Interactive Widgets**  
  - Dropdown selector: filter data by the number of cylinders or model year.  
  - Slider: adjust the car weight range dynamically.  

- **Visualizations**  
  - Histogram: shows the overall distribution of MPG values.  
  - Bar Chart: compares average MPG across different cylinder categories.  
  - Scatter Plot: visualizes the relationship between car weight and fuel efficiency.  
  - Line Chart: displays the trend of average MPG across years.

## ðŸ§  Insights

- Cars with **fewer cylinders** tend to have **higher fuel efficiency (MPG)**.  
- **Heavier cars** generally show **lower MPG values**, indicating that weight negatively affects efficiency.  
- The **average MPG** has **improved steadily over time**, suggesting advancements in automotive technology.  
- The overall **distribution of MPG** shows that most cars achieve moderate efficiency, with only a few being highly fuel-efficient.
